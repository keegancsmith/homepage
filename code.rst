I publish most of my code on Bitbucket_. I also contribute to projects on
Launchpad_. I have a profile on GitHub_, but it is mostly a mirror of my
Bitbucket_ page.

Here is a list of projects I started (and mostly badly maintain) which other
people use:

* FUSEPod_
* :doc:`projects/AmarokPidgin`
* :doc:`projects/AmarokQuilt`
* `Vodacom SMS Script`_ (Python)

This list is poorly maintained (for now), so the best place to look for my
current work is on Bitbucket_ as I mentioned above.

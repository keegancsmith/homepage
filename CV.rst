Employment History
==================

* **2012** - Currently a Software Engineer at `Facebook
  <https://www.facebook.com/>`_.

* **2012** - Contract work `Snapbill <http://snapbill.com/>`_. Technologies
  used: PHP, Python, Puppet

* **2011** - Internship at `Nimbula <http://nimbula.com/>`_. Wrote an EC2 API
  Shim. This was a service which exposed an EC2 SOAP and REST API and
  translated the requests into Nimbula Director API requests. Technologies
  used: Python and Twisted.

* **2010** - Internship at `Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ on
  the EC2 Team. My first project was replacing an internal XML-RPC system with
  something faster (ended up being JSON). The second project was creating a
  distributed monitoring system of the EC2 API, which alarms on elevated
  failure rates. Technologies used: Java, Python and EC2.

* **2008** - Contracting work at `CareerJunction
  <http://www.careerjunction.co.za/>`_ as a Junior Python Developer. Wrote a
  restful broker in Django which validates/transforms HRXML documents to
  internal systems. Technologies used: Django, lxml and the TurboGears Stack.

* **2008** - Wrote a command-line wrapper around libgpod for iPod syncing in
  the `Fun Station Project <http://www.funstation.com.br/>`_. Technologies
  used: C.

* **2007** - System Administration and Code maintenance for `The Hitforge
  <http://www.hitforge.com/>`_. Technologies used: FreeBSD, Trac, PHP,
  Apache, eJabberD, Python.

* **2007** - Vacation work at `Postilion
  <http://www.postilion.com/>`_. Maintenance and feature addition for
  management reports. Technologies used: Python & SQL Server.

* **2007** - Set course-work for 1st year Python course at University of Cape
  Town.  The Python course is a course for above average students, that
  already know how to program in Java. Topics covered: Python Syntax and Data
  Type, UML, Unit Testing, Regular Expressions and Functional Programming.

* **2006** - Two internships at Standard Bank. I was a bursary student, but
  discontinued the bursary to look for more interesting opportunities. I did
  work in C# and Java. C# work was a basic front-end to a SQL database. The
  Java work was Servlets for another database. Another project that I worked
  on was a Java servlet that generated a graph of the dependencies between
  Oracle databases.

Programming Languages

I am proficient in the following languages:

* Python
* Java
* C/C++

I have written small amounts of code in the following languages:

* Emacs Lisp
* Haskell
* Bash
* C#
* PHP
* XSLT


Open Source Project
===================

I enjoy using open source software and often publish code I have written as
open source. See my `code <http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~ksmith/code.html>`_
for more info.

.. FUSEPod
.. -------

.. `FUSEPod <http://fusepod.sf.net/>`_ is a user space file system that uses
.. `FUSE <http://fuse.sf.net>`_ to mount an iPod for easy browsing of the
.. songs. Written in C++. Uses FUSE and libgpod.

.. AmarokPidgin
.. ------------

.. `AmarokPidgin <http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~ksmith/AmarokPidgin.html>`_ is a
.. plug-in for Amarok that updates your Pidgin status message with what you are
.. currently listening to. Written in Python. Uses DCOP and DBUS for
.. inter-process communication.


Olympiads
=========

I have participated in many computer olympiads. These are contests that test
your problem solving skills as well as implementation, testing and debugging
skills. Below is a summary of my results in major contests in chronological
order.
